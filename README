#README


*In this project I split up the work I did using various algorithms into
three separate files. 


*The poi_id.py contains my best performing algorithm and the one I am using 
to meet the project's scoring requirement. 


*Poi_id_DT.py includes the work I did on a decision tree algorithm 
and poi_id_GB.py includes the work I did on a GaussianNB algorithm. 


*The project's questions and my responses are also in a separate file in the 
directory.
